Until now, decisions to enhance my son's skills were mostly intuition-based. With MiniStats, I now have a comprehensive awareness that guides me in a more informed and purposeful approach to his advancement. It reaffirms my belief that a child's development should be a shared responsibility, with tools like MiniStats empowering parents to play an active role alongside the academy.",

    text: "In the last three years, we invested in paid personal training sessions for both of our sons. Despite the dedication, it was challenging for the trainer to attend their games and provide personalized insights for improvement. Enter MiniStats â€“ a game-changer! Collaborating seamlessly with our son's academy, the weekly Player Card reports we receive are now shared with the trainer. This collaboration has revolutionized our sons' training experience, translating into remarkable improvements in just the last three months. The impact has far exceeded what we invested in the past three years. MiniStats has not only enhanced the value of our training sessions but has also become an invaluable tool in our sons' developmental journey.",
